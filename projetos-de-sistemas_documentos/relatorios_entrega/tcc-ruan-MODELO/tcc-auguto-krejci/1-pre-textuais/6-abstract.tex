\hspace{1.5cm} Natural disasters are a long-standing danger to the well-being and survival of humanity. Predict when they will occur, where, and in what intensity, is decisive for mitigating risks, losses and material damages to the population. This paper applies concepts of artificial intelligence, more specifically in a specialization of machine learning called deep learning. It proposes the elaboration of a model capable of predicting the level of a watershed, from the information of rain and level sensors installed in it, aiming at promoting alerts to the potentially affected population. The model uses a type of deep learning algorithm called Long Short-Time Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network quite suitable for time series regression problems. The model presented good results, in the applied metrics, and proved to be a viable model.
